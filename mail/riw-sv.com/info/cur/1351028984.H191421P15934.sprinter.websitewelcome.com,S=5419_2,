Hi Sir/Madam,

I just learned about the event yesterday and felt really upset that the
registration is closed.

I am a Stanford graduate and a business owner of a public company, Advanced
Card Systems. We make payment systems for public transportation. We have
plans to find strategic business partners in Russia to help to improve the
transportation system there, and I deem this as a perfect opportunity to
mingle with the Russia representatives. I hope to connect with the Russian
speakers to seek for partnerships. I have around 1300 Linkedin connections
and will be glad to help the speakers if they need anything in Bay Area as
well if I have the honor to meet them.

Can you please kindly make an exception to let me join the conference? Your
help will be greatly appreciated.

I understand it's a lot of hard work for you to organize such a big event
and I apologize for any inconvenience caused.

Regards,
Chi Ho
