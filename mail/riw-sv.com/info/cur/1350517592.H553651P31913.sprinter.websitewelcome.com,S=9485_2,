Dear: Dr. Victor Vekselberg, President of the Skolkovo Foundation.

  We are really interested about the remarkable context that the Russian Innovation Week create to facilitate an excellent environment to do business and congregate Russian and Americans people with similar interests, such as explore partnerships for technological innovations, investment opportunities or technology ventures. We are a corporation formed by different Technological Companies (Unmanned Air Vehicles), Technology and Innovation Consulting, Software Development and an IT Service Company (Spectrum Consulting Corp, Giga-K) with headquarter in Monterrey, Nuevo León.

  Currently, most of the Mexican companies, venture capitalist and Mexican startup entrepreneurs are really concerned with the benefits that an environment of cross-border business opportunities bring for them. For this reason we would like to work together with you to bring to them, a local Russian Innovation Week in México (focusing on the areas of biotech, life sciences, cleantech, nanotechnology and IT & C) that could offer them an excellent environment for business and investment opportunities for Russian-Mexicans investors and entrepreneurs.
Thank you in advance for your answer. We would be waiting for your kindly reply.
