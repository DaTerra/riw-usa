Dear Sir or Madam,

Unfortunately, we have not learned in time about Russian Innovation
Week event in Mountain View. We still hope to attend if this is at all
possible. If not, please keep us appraised of future events.
We are an EDA software "startup" with major semiconductor
manufacturers. Majority of our founders are Russians, so it would be
very interesting to learn about other innovative russian businesses.
With Best Regards,
Anatoly Adamov
CEO, Alphray Inc.
