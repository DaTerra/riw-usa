Dear Team of Russian Innovation Week,

My name is Olga Stepanova and I am registered attendee of the Russian
Innovation Week conference.

I am writing to clarify if it is possible to include two more persons to the
list of participants. I know that the registration is already over, however
if there is a possibility to put people in a waiting list, please add:

 Oliver Gassner, 
Tengis Bat-erdene.

Both of them are experienced professionals and MBA students at Hult
International Business School.

If more detailed information required, please say.

Thank you very much for your time.

Best regards,
Olga Stepanova
