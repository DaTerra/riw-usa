Dear Sir or Madame,

I am a Russian speaking US Immigration Attorney in San Francisco, CA. I h=
ave been in law practice for 10 years specializing in Business and Family=
 Immigration matters, such as visas and green cards for scientists, inves=
tors, computer programers, etc.  

I just found out about the Russian Innovation Week conference, which will=
 be taking place in Mountain View, CA at the end of the week. I understan=
d that the registration is already closed. In fact, I would not have been=
 able to attend on Thursday, the 25th anyway. 

I was wondering if it's possible to register and attend just on Friday th=
e 26th. I would really appreciate the opportunity to network with the Rus=
sian business community at this event.

I will look forward to hearing from you.

Thank you.

Sincerely,

Svetlana
