Hello,

I tried RSVPing to the Russian Innovation Week through the link, and gave
the code provided in this Email, plus my contact information.  After I
pressed "Yes, I Confirm", a new registration page appeared.  Does that mean
that the system did not register me?  Could you please confirm my
attendance?

Thank you,

Elena Kogan
