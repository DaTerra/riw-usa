hi there... i get a *lot* of email. guessing you do too. this is one
of those annoying auto-replies you probably think makes me seem
pretentious & full of crap.

so i hope you won't be bummed out when i confess there's probably ~20%
chance i'll read your email, and maybe only ~5% chance i'll respond.
yeah, really... it's that bad.

it's not like you're not sexy & awesome & amazing, but if i spent all
my time answering email, i'd never get any other shit done. and since
i'm planning on changing the world, i really need to make sure i GET
SHIT DONE.

so i'll do my best to read & maybe respond to email, but if it's
really important you may need to reach me through other channels.

if this email is related to *new* investment opportunities, please
note that we have just added ~35 new companies to our Fall 2012
Startup Accelerator program, and we may be a little busy integrating
all of the new people & companies.

if it's URGENT, and/or you are a 500 Startups investor, founder,
mentor or partner, or if we are in the middle of a deal, then PLEASE
give me a call or text if you have my phone #.  you can also put a
respond by date in the subject line so i have a better chance of
catching it. or read below for more info on how to get in touch.

OR YOU CAN SEND ME AN ALL-CAPS EMAIL AND I MIGHT READ THAT.

or i might not.

if you'd like, you may be able to reach other members of the 500 team
or me faster by filling out this form:
 http://awayfind.com/500startups

in the meantime, if you want to follow extremely interesting updates
about me brushing my teeth & other crap, go here:

 http://twitter.com/davemcclure

for completely unproductive & NSFW images & videos, go here:

if you've read this far, you are very dedicated. i encourage you to
spend less time reading my auto responder, and more time reading a
good book or playing Angry Birds.

peace out.

- dave mcclure
