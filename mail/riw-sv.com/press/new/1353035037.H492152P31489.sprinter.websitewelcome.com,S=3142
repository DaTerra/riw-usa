RE: PROJECT WITH YOU/YOUR COMPANY.

Hello,

I have been instructed by my employer to write you this email on his =20
behalf as he is interested in working with you after getting your =20
contact information from the Internet directory of your Chamber of =20
Commerce.

My employer is the manager of F-R, UK, based in Scotland. We normally =20
act as advisors to clients wishing to invest in Scotland. However, we =20
have a client who wants to turn her assets into investments and even =20
though she will do some investments in Scotland, she prefers for the =20
bulk of the investments to be in other countries and after looking at =20
the growth prospects, we have chosen your country as a good =20
destination for investments.

The main idea is that we have not worked outside of Scotland in this =20
manner in the past, thus, we wish to get other professionals, like =20
you, based in your country to collaborate with us in establishing a =20
company or several companies under which the above tasks will be =20
carried out.

Our priority will be Property Development and Tourism, where my =20
employer is an expert, whereas we will also provide Loans/Venture =20
Capital in other sectors. As Venture Capitalists, we shall focus on =20
companies in Healthcare, Mining and Renewable Energy. It is important =20
to note that the total value of the assets which our client shall =20
invest is USD 60 Million.

We do propose that if you are interested in this process, we nominate =20
you, along with my employer, as a director on the board of the new =20
company and for this there will of course be compensation/commission.

Now because I am not sure you will have interest in this process, I =20
have given just the basic details.

If you would like to work with us, do get in touch via the telephone =20
number and emails which I shall include below for more details, but if =20
you have no interest in this process, I apologize for any =20
inconvenience caused.

Yours Sincerely.

Victor Angel
